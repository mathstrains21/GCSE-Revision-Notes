## Embedded Systems

An embedded system is a computer built into a larger device.
They are normally dedicated systems.
They are often used for control systems to monitor and control machinery to achieve a desired result.

They are dedicated to do a single task, so they only need to be given enough resources and memory to do this.
This makes them cheaper to build.
They are usually coded in a low level language like Assembly so they are as efficient as possible.

Embedded systems can be found in many places, such as dishwashers, microwaves, TVs, washing machines, cameras, segways,
drones and even Baby Annabell Cry and Poop dolls.
