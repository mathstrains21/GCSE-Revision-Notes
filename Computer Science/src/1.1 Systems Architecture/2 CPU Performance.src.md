## CPU Performance

### Clock Speed

Clock speed is the number of instructions a core can execute per second (Hz).
This is typically around 3.5 GHz (3 billion instructions per second) for desktop computers.
The higher the clock speed, the more instructions that can be executed every second.

Sometimes, CPU's can be overclocked so they run higher than the factory-set clock speed.
This can cause CPU's to overheat, which can cause crashes or damage to the system.
Cooling systems are required, such as water cooling.

### Cache Size

Cache is data storage inside the CPU that is much faster than RAM.
A bigger cache means that more data the CPU needs to process can be accessed quickly.

### Number of Cores

Each core in a CPU can process data and instructions separately from the rest.
The more cores a CPU has, the more isntructions it can process simultaneously, so the faster it can process data.
Most computers have at least 4 cores nowadays.

Multi-core CPU's will only increase performance if a program is designed to use it.
