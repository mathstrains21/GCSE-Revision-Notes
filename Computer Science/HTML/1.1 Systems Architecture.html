                    <p>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It processes the data and instructions that make a computer work.</p>
                
            
                
                    <p>Most CPU's use the Von Neumann architecture, designed in 1945. The CPU runs programs stored in memory. Programs consist of instructions and data, stored in memory addresses. Only one memory is used, to store both the data and the instructions.</p>

                    <h3>Clock Speed</h3>
                
            
                
                    <p>Clock speed is the number of instructions a core can execute per second (Hz). This is typically around 3.5 GHz (3 billion instructions per second) for desktop computers. The higher the clock speed, the more instructions that can be executed every second.</p>
                
            
                
                    <p>Sometimes, CPU's can be overclocked so they run higher than the factory-set clock speed. This can cause CPU's to overheat, which can cause crashes or damage to the system. Cooling systems are required, such as water cooling.</p>

                    <p>Cache is data storage inside the CPU that is much faster than RAM. A bigger cache means that more data the CPU needs to process can be accessed quickly.</p>

                    <p>Each core in a CPU can process data and instructions separately from the rest. The more cores a CPU has, the more isntructions it can process simultaneously, so the faster it can process data. Most computers have at least 4 cores nowadays.</p>
                
            
                
                    <p>Multi-core CPU's will only increase performance if a program is designed to use it.</p>
                
            
                
                    <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
                
            
                
                    <p>An embedded system is a computer built into a larger device. They are normally dedicated systems. They are often used for control systems to monitor and control machinery to achieve a desired result.</p>
                
            
                
                    <p>They are dedicated to do a single task, so they only need to be given enough resources and memory to do this. This makes them cheaper to build. They are usually coded in a low level language like Assembly so they are as efficient as possible.</p>
                
            
                
                    <p>Embedded systems can be found in many places, such as dishwashers, microwaves, TVs, washing machines, cameras, segways, drones and even Baby Annabell Cry and Poop dolls.</p>
